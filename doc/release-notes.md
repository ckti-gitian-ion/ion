Mandatory Update
==============


How to Upgrade
==============

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/ION-Qt (on Mac) or iond/ion-qt (on Linux).


Compatibility
==============

Ion Core is extensively tested on multiple operating systems using the Linux kernel, macOS 10.10+, and Windows 7 and later.

Microsoft ended support for Windows XP on [April 8th, 2014](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/WindowsForBusiness/end-of-xp-support), No attempt is made to prevent installing or running the software on Windows XP, you can still do so at your own risk but be aware that there are known instabilities and issues. Please do not report issues about Windows XP to the issue tracker.

Apple released it's last Mountain Lion update August 13, 2015, and officially ended support on [December 14, 2015](http://news.fnal.gov/2015/10/mac-os-x-mountain-lion-10-8-end-of-life-december-14/). ION Core software starting with v3.2.0 will no longer run on MacOS versions prior to Yosemite (10.10). Please do not report issues about MacOS versions prior to Yosemite to the issue tracker.
 
ION Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not frequently tested on them.
 
Notable Changes
==============

Minimum Supported MacOS Version
------

The minimum supported version of MacOS (OSX) has been moved from 10.8 Mountain Lion to 10.10 Yosemite. Users still running a MacOS version prior to Yosemite will need to upgrade their OS if they wish to continue using the latest version(s) of the ION Core wallet.

Major New Features
------

### BIP65 (CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY) Soft-Fork

ION Core v3.2.0 introduces new consensus rules for scripting pathways to support the [BIP65](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0065.mediawiki) standard. This is being carried out as a soft-fork in order to provide ample time for stakers to update their wallet version.

### Automint Addresses

A new "Automint Addresses" feature has been added to the wallet that allows for the creation of new addresses who's purpose is to automatically convert any ION funds received by such addresses to xION. The feature as a whole can be enabled/disabled either at runtime using the `-enableautoconvertaddress` option, via RPC/Console with the `enableautomintaddress` command, or via the GUI's options dialog, with the default being enabled.

Creation of these automint addresses is currently only available via the RPC/Console `createautomintaddress` command, which takes no additional arguments. The command returns a new ION address each time, but addresses created by this command can be re-used if desired.

### In-wallet Proposal Voting

A new UI wallet tab has been introduced that allows users to view the current budget proposals, their vote counts, and vote on proposals if the wallet is acting as a masternode controller. The visual design is to be considered temporary, and will be undergoing further design and display improvements in the future.

### Zerocoin Lite Node Protocol

Support for the ZLN Protocol has been added, which allows for a node to opt-in to providing extended network services for the protocol. By default, this functionality is disabled, but can be enabled by using the `-peerbloomfilterszc` runtime option.

A full technical writeup of the protocol can be found [Here](https://ioncoin.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Zerocoin_Light_Node_Protocol.pdf).

GUI Changes
------

### Console Security Warning

Due to an increase in social engineering attacks/scams that rely on users relaying information from console commands, a new warning message has been added to the Console window's initial welcome message.

### Optional Hiding of Orphan Stakes

The options dialog now contains a checkbox option to hide the display of orphan stakes from both the overview and transaction history sections. Further, a right-click context menu option has been introduced in the transaction history tab to achieve the same effect.

**Note:** This option only affects the visual display of orphan stakes, and will not prevent them nor remove them from the underlying wallet database.

### Transaction Type Recoloring

The color of various transaction types has been reworked to provide better visual feedback. Staking and masternode rewards are now purple, orphan stakes are now light gray, other rejected transactions are in red, and normal receive/send transactions are black.

### Receive Tab Changes

The address to be used when creating a new payment request is now automatically displayed in the form. This field is not user-editable, and will be updated as needed by the wallet.

A new button has been added below the payment request form, "Receiving Addresses", which allows for quicker access to all the known receiving addresses. This one-click button is the same as using the `File->Receiving Addresses...` menu command, and will open up the Receiving Addresses UI dialog.

Historical payment requests now also display the address used for the request in the history table. While this information was already available when clicking the "Show" button, it was an extra step that shouldn't have been necessary.

### Privacy Tab Changes

The entire right half of the privacy tab can now be toggled (shown/hidden) via a new UI button. This was done to reduce "clutter" for users that may not wish to see the detailed information regarding individual denomination counts.

RPC Changes
------

### Backupwallet Sanity

The `backupwallet` RPC command no longer allows for overwriting the currently in use wallet.dat file. This was done to avoid potential file corruption caused by multiple conflicting file access operations.

Build System Changes
------

### Completely Disallow Qt4

Compiling the ION Core wallet against Qt4 hasn't been supported for quite some time now, but the build system still recognized Qt4 as a valid option if Qt5 couldn't be found. This has now been remedied and Qt4 will no longer be considered valid during the `configure` pre-compilation phase.

### Further OpenSSL Deprecation

Up until now, the zerocoin library relied exclusively on OpenSSL for it's bignum implementation. This has now been changed with the introduction of GMP as an arithmetic operator and the bignum implementation has now been redesigned around GMP. Users can still opt to use OpenSSL for bignum by passing `--with-zerocoin-bignum=openssl` to the `configure` script, however such configuration is now deprecated.

**Note:** This change introduces a new dependency on GMP (libgmp) by default.

### RISC-V Support

Support for the new RISC-V 64bit processors has been added, though still experimental. Pre-compiled binaries for this CPU architecture are available for linux, and users can self-compile using gitian, depends, or an appropriate host system natively.
